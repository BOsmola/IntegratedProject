The lecturer also informed us that we will need to make sure our project uses original data that we collect ourselves and not to use data collected by anyone else. We also need to make sure the location we collect data from hasn’t been used before for a similar project.

This will allow us to compare our data to theirs and even use that data to properly calibrate our device. The lecturer also mentioned that union street would be the best location for the project as he did something similar and got good data from union street.

We will continue to look on places like eBay for second had models. We will also try CEX and RS Components in the city centre to see if we can get one there. We have found the type of emissions senor to use (SDS011 Sensor) and it is relatively cheap and available on amazon for £25. 
              The team agreed to split into three groups of two to complete the project planning report. Steven and Gerald will complete the initial tasks and roles section, Ross and Bart will complete the project timeline and Daniil and Chris will complete the risk analysis. Everyone will start working on their tasks today and we will try to have the planning report complete by tomorrow night Thursday 17th of February.
